            <h1>General info</h1>

            <p>
                Glomerulonephritis is a group of diseases that injure the part of the kidney that filters blood (called glomeruli). Other terms you may hear used are nephritis and nephrotic syndrome. When the kidney is injured, it cannot get rid of wastes and extra fluid in the body. If the illness continues, the kidneys may stop working completely, resulting in kidney failure

                There are two types of glomerulonephritisâ€”acute and chronic. The acute form develops suddenly. You may get it after an infection in your throat or on your skin. Sometimes, you may get better on your own. Other times, your kidneys may stop working unless the right treatment is started quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glomerulonephritis occurs on its own or as part of another disease, such as lupus or diabetes. Severe or prolonged inflammation associated with glomerulonephritis can damage your kidneys. Treatment depends on the type of glomerulonephritis you have

            <h1>Cause</h1>

            <p>
                The acute glomerulonephritis disease may be caused by infections such as strep throat. It may also be caused by other illnesses, including lupus, Goodpasture's syndrome, Wegener's disease, and polyarteritis nodosa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, chronic glomerulonephritis disease runs in the family. This kind often shows up in young men who may also have hearing loss and vision loss. Some forms are caused by changes in the immune system. However, in many cases, the cause is not known. Sometimes, you will have one acute attack of the disease and develop the chronic form years later.
