            <p>
                Steroid myopathy is usually an insidious disease process that causes weakness mainly to the proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs and to the neck flexors. Cushing originally described it in 1932, and Muller and Kugelberg first studied it systemically in 1959.

                Steroid treatment of MS – as with steroid treatment of lupus, organ transplant rejection, and acute asthma – can induce anxiety, euphoria, mania, depressive symptoms, and psychosis. Likewise, Cushing syndrome and other conditions that generate excessive steroid production can produce these symptoms.

                Even athletes surreptitiously using steroids for bodybuilding and energy can develop personality and behavioral changes. Steroids often produce insomnia, ravenous appetite, and tremor, any of which constitutes the first sign of steroid treatment. The influence of pre-existing psychiatric illness as a risk factor remains controversial.

            <p>
                An excess of either endogenous or exogenous corticosteroids is believed to cause the condition. Excess endogenous corticosteroid production can arise from adrenal tumors. An excess of exogenous corticosteroid can result from steroid treatment for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and inflammatory processes, such as polymyositis, connective tissue disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis

                Breast surgery has seen several innovations that have made certain procedures more patient-specific. The type of implant you choose as well as its shape and size are all considerations that need to be made before undergoing surgery. The placement of your implants is also important so you are completely satisfied with your results.

                With the amount of options you have to choose from, it can be difficult to find the best solution when learning about breast augmentation. Through a personal consultation, however, you can discuss your expectations and choose the technique that suits you best.
